                We have a team of highly skilled radiologists who are readily available for almost instantaneous viewing of medical imaging results. This enables physician practices and hospitals to provide better patient care, allowing them to diagnose and treat a patient quicker and more efficiently.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Imaging centers can be radiologist-free, and it also allows radiologists to work from the location of their preference. Patients can also get specialist second advice.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Cloud-based workflows are incorporated in ICARE TELERADIOLOGY for fast diagnosis by radiologists, and storage of images for future reference is also done.
